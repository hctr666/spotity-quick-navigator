# Spotify Quick Navigator - WIP
A desktop app to manage basic controls of an active spotify client.
Using electronjs as the core server and reactjs for the UI.

## Prerequisites
you'll need to create an app on the spotify developers [dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard) first.

## Setup the server .env file
1. copy the `server/.env.example` file and rename it to `.env`
2. once you got it take your credentials from spotify dashboard and set them on the `.env` file

## Run locally
1. run `npm install` in the ui and server folders
2. to start locally just run `sh bin/start.sh`

That's it!
